# Introduction | Introdução

This project was initially made to teach a friend
of mine, from the basics of HTML to the advanced stuff of JS in a fun way.

So i've made a template(3 of them in total) on illustrator, drew some cats
(several times untill i get something decent), did some sounds and started to code it.

I've made an handout to teach her, and still have some pages.
*All the old files i could find are in the "miscellaneous" folder, just for the sake of nostalgia and entertainment.

### **All the assets was done by me, except the music theme.**

Esse projeto foi inicialmente criado para ensinar uma amiga minha,
do básico do HTML até JS avançado de uma forma divertida.
Então eu fiz um template(3 deles num total) no Illustrator, desenhei
alguns gatos (severas vezes, até conseguir algo descente), fiz alguns
sons e comecei a codar.

Eu fiz uma apostila para ensiná-la, e ainda tenho algumas páginas.
*Todos os arquivos antigos que pude encontrar estão na pasta "miscellaneous",
por nostalgia e entretenimento.

### **Todas as artes, sons e códigos foram feitos por mim, exceto a música tema.**

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

\\
See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
